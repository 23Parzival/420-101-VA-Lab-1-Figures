Here is where I will put the answers to lab 1.

PartII:

#6 Only the necessary files containing the classes are put in the repository as to avoid clutter and confusion.

Part III:

#2 The circle moves down. The circle becomes invisible and if done again nothing happens.

#6 An error occurs.

#9 Add square, change color to red, make larger using changeSize method and move to the center of the screen.
   Add square, change color to black and  move to left side of the first square.
   Add triangle, change color to green, make larger using changeSize method and move to the top of the two squares.
   Add circle, change color to yellow, make larger using changeSize method and move up and to the right of the house. 
   This could be done by first adding all the objects and then changing their appearance and position, or
   any other sequence.
